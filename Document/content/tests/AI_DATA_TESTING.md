## 3.4 🟨 AI Data Testing

The **AI Data Testing** category focuses on the validation and protection of data utilized throughout the AI lifecycle, including training datasets, inference inputs, and runtime interactions. This category emphasizes verifying data quality, ensuring robust privacy protections, assessing dataset coverage, and preventing harmful or inappropriate content from negatively influencing AI systems.

Data-related vulnerabilities can have wide-ranging impacts, from privacy violations and data exfiltration to biases and unsafe model behaviors. Comprehensive AI Data Testing addresses these risks by systematically evaluating datasets for diversity, compliance, security, and appropriateness, thereby ensuring the ethical, robust, and secure operation of AI applications.

### 🔍 Scope of This Testing Category

This category evaluates whether the AI data:

- Prevents **unintended exposure or leakage of sensitive training data**

   → [AITG-DAT-01: Testing for Training Data Exposure](https://github.com/MatOwasp/AI-Testing-Guide/blob/main/Document/content/tests/AITG-DAT-01_Testing_for_Training_Data_Exposure.md)

- Is secure against **runtime exfiltration of sensitive or private information**

  → [AITG-DAT-02: Testing for Runtime Exfiltration](https://github.com/MatOwasp/AI-Testing-Guide/blob/main/Document/content/tests/AITG-DAT-02_Testing_for_Runtime_Exfiltration.md)

- Provides sufficient **diversity, representation, and comprehensive coverage** to avoid bias or performance gaps

  → [AITG-DAT-03: Testing for Dataset Diversity & Coverage](https://github.com/MatOwasp/AI-Testing-Guide/blob/main/Document/content/tests/AITG-DAT-03_Testing_for_Dataset_Diversity_and_Coverage.md)

- Is free from **harmful, toxic, or biased content**

  → [AITG-DAT-04: Testing for Harmful Content in Data](https://github.com/MatOwasp/AI-Testing-Guide/blob/main/Document/content/tests/AITG-DAT-04_Testing_for_Harmful_Content_in_Data.md)

- Aligns with **data minimization principles and consent requirements** as mandated by regulations and privacy best practices

  → [AITG-DAT-05: Testing for Data Minimization & Consent](https://github.com/MatOwasp/AI-Testing-Guide/blob/main/Document/content/tests/AITG-DAT-05_Testing_for_Data_Minimization_and_Consent.md)

Each test within the AI Data Testing category ensures that datasets powering AI models meet essential quality, ethical, security, and compliance standards, ultimately contributing to safer and more responsible AI systems.
